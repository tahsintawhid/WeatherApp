# WeatherData

This is a data analysis project that retrieves weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API, stores it in a SQLite database, cleans the data, and generates statistics and visualizations.
I had already been familiar with using databases and retrieving select data, as well as cleaning data. However, this was my first time using an API for data, as well as creating visualizations using matplotlib to display data. I then decided to learn and add a user-friendly web interface via Flask to display my data in an easier manner.
